<h2>About</h2>

A mod that is so large, that if I would of tried to let all of the 2,091 structures loaded in cache from a single file, your mobile device would crash instantly. Due to this, I had to seperate each structure according to their theme. This is why there's many varients of '<i>X-Structures - Houses.js</i>' and other structure types.
